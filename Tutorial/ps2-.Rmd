## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages('remotes')
install.packages("astsa")

library(astsa)

soi
```



```{r}
n = length(soi)
AIC = rep(0, 30)
AICc= rep(0,30)
BIC=  rep(0,30)
for (k in 1:30)
  {
variance = ar(soi, order=k, aic=FALSE)$var.pred
AIC[k] = log(variance) + ((n+2*k)/n)
BIC[k] = log(variance) + (k*log(n)/n)
AICc[k] = log(variance) + ((n+k)/(n-k-2))

}
IC = cbind(AIC,BIC,AICc)
ts.plot(IC, type="o", xlab="p", ylab="AIC/BIC/AICc")

AIC
AICc
BIC

#From the row we see that AIC and AICc almost have the same value.
#Since AIC and AICc are quite identical to each other, we might want to shift them.(I.e,shift AIC to obtain a more clear graph)

IC_shifted=cbind(AIC-0.5, BIC,AICc)

ts.plot(IC_shifted, type="o", xlab="p", ylab="AIC/BIC/AICc")
grid(nx=6,ny=7,col="grey",lty=2,lwd=2)

#As we can see, the all 3 curves tend to obtain minimum at p=15
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
